# py_modular_synth
A modular synthetizer prototype made in python

## About

This is a side project I worked on when I was in internship. I created this to familiarize myself with the lovely world of modular synthesizers and I should work on this again because it's fun but the actual code is a bit ugly and there is not a lot of features

## Usage

You can look at `__main__.py` to see how I used different wave generators and mixed them together to create interesting sounds, but a knowledge of modular synths is needed to understand what this is doing, sorry :(

## Example
